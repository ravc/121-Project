The master file format is:
First line(x): number of drivers
next x lines: Drivername Drivermoney lon lat photofilename
Line after that (y): number of customers
next y lines: Custoname Customoney photofilename
line after that (z): number of places
next z lines: Planename Placeaddress lon lat numtags(n) [tag1 tag2 ... tagn] photofilename

We used Luke's Hw 5, and integrated it into our project.

File structure:
Seperate header files for each class (place,drivers,customers,images,windows,etc)
window/graphics files
master file (all customer, driver and place info)
main file 

Important classes and functions, and their data members:
Place_info: name, address, longitude, latitude, vector of tags, photo filename
customers: name, money, photo filename
drivers: name, money, longitude, latitude, photo filename
window structures for adding & removoving all 3: callback functions for adding and removing (calls class constructors)
window structure for displaying all 3: callback functions to display info with FLTK
window structure for making payment: callback functions to transfer money from a customer to a driver
window structure for requesting a ride: callback functions to request a ride. can be based on location or tags, and finds the nearestr driver.
